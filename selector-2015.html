            There are a small percentage of families each year who are disappointed where the school cannot offer a place. If this happens to you, the School Admissions Team can give you information on school admission appeals and can also give advice on other schools that may have places available. Please feel free to contact us on email <a href="mailto:school.admissions@gloucestershire.gov.uk">school.admissions@gloucestershire.gov.uk</a> or call 01452 425407.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you feel you would like to pursue the matter further, you can have your case heard by an Appeal Panel that is independent of the Local Authority or, in the case of trust, foundation or voluntary aided schools and academies, by an Appeal Panel that is independent of the school's admission authority.

            <h3>Key Stage One refusal</h3><h4>Part A of the Appeals Guide explains the reasons for a Key Stage One refusal. </h4>
            <p>
                The way in which the classes are organised within this school means that your application has been refused because the class in which the reception children are taught has reached its legal limit of 30 children per class. Children who have been offered places in the reception year group have been offered in line with the admission arrangements for the school. The children who have been offered places had a stronger claim to a place at the school. This means that the school had reached its published admission number before your child's position on the over subscription criteria. The year group is now full.
            </p>
            <p>
                The School Standards and Framework Act 1998, requires infant classes (Reception, Year 1 and Year 2) to consist of no more than 30 pupils.
            </p>
            <p>
                A place at this school has therefore been refused under Section 1(6) of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998 (duty of Local Education Authorities and Governing Bodies to comply with infant class sizes), and Section 86 of the same Act, on the grounds that compliance with the preference would prejudice the provision of efficient education and the efficient use of resources, by failing to limit all infant classes to a maximum of 30 pupils.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the Admissions Authority for the school, we are unable to offer your child a place at this school in accordance with the Infant Class Size Prejudice.

                    Once your appeal form has been received it will be logged and your appeal panel and date will be arranged. A clerk to the Appeal Panel will send you a letter giving the date, time and place of the appeal hearing approximately two weeks before the hearing. Appeal Hearings are due to start in the second week of June.

                    Before the appeal hearing, you will also receive a written statement from the Admission Authority for the school, which will give the reasons why your child was not allocated a place in the school you wanted.

            <h2>Other Information</h2>
            <p>
                You should not wait for the outcome of an appeal about one school before deciding to appeal about another as appeals can be made for more than one school at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parents who have appealed unsuccessfully for a particular school cannot appeal again for a place at the same school, in the same academic year, unless there have been significant and material changes in their circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Appeals for schools outside Gloucestershire should be made in accordance with the published admission arrangements of the local authority concerned.

            <h3>The school is it's own Admission Authority</h3><h4>If the Guide asks you to contact the school/academy directly, this is because the school is its own Admission Authority</h4>
            <p>
                The published admission number for this school has been reached by offering places to children in line with the admission arrangements for the school. These children had a stronger claim to a place at the school. This means that the school had reached its published admission number before your child's position on the over subscription criteria and the year group is now full.
            </p>
            <p>
                You have a legal right to appeal for a place at the school. If you wish to appeal, you need to write to the Governors of the school directly. Please use the school's contact details but address any correspondence to the Governing Body of the school.

            <h3>Overcrowding</h3><h4>Part B of the Appeals Guide explains the reasons for an Overcrowding Appeal.</h4>
            <p>
                The published admission number for this school has been reached by offering places to children in line with the admission arrangements for the school. These children had a stronger claim to a place at the school. This means that the school had reached its published admission number before your child's position on the over subscription criteria and the year group is now full.
            </p>
            <p>
                If another child were added to the year group, this would lead to overcrowding or make overcrowding worse at the school. This will in turn cause problems with providing a high standard of education to pupils at the school.
            </p>
            <p>
                In view of the fact Reception is full at this school has been refused for your child under the terms of Section 86 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, on the grounds that compliance with the preference would prejudice the provision of efficient education or the efficient use of resources for reasons for overcrowding.
